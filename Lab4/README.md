| Divisibility by 3 failed, Divisibility by 3 passed| 3be46caba229c00db4cac80e59542d00e47c8b74, 316745e537482426f30e27baecd962b93bd752e0 | Here we want to test if when the number is divisible by 3 it returns "Fizz". The test initially failed and the code was refactored for the test group to pass.

| Check result equality for two integers failed, Check result equality for two integers passed | 60299d500a0a3ab9803a553981c4a976d3879de0, 53091b1a3b8c6e97390f8c642a1e1c62b021c736| Here we want to test if the result of two integers is equal or not. For example, 3 is "Fizz" and 9 is "Fizz" so we expect true. The test initially failed and the code was refactored for the test group to pass.
