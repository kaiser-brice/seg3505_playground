<b>Stubbed Code:</b>
<img src = images/stubbed_code.png/>
In this part, we created stubs with the purpose of creating the signature for the methods that are connected to the rest of the syste. These methods are only there to see if our modules connect together properly to form our system. For this, we must ensure that our parameters are the same as the ones we will use in our final implementation. We randomly returned values so as to make sure the backend components are properly interconnected
